      Hey, I’m Myles! I’m 13, still in school and from the United Kingdom. I am really into coding. I’ve taught myself most of what I know so far and I’m still learning new things every day — like Python, HTML, JavaScript, and Lua.

      I made this website to try out my skills and see what I can build, it can help others find me. I’m pretty proud of it and can’t wait to keep getting better! I have mostly done this site from my phone but some on a school laptop. I hope I will be able to buy myself a laptop soon!
